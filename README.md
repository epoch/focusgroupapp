## Notes from this project
  * functionality is key, get that first, worry about looks later
  * allow more time than you think for front end
    - even using bootsrap takes time
  * commit early, comit often

## To-do/Wishlist
  * make the site more navagatable (some things i would like to be links that are not)
  * add email confirmation to creating an account

This project was originally built for General Assembly Sydney's WDI Summer '13 class.
